# 🚀 Advanced Web Development – Hands-on Scenario

In this scenario, the focus is on **building a functional, real web application** rather than isolated code examples.

At the beginning of the course, we will **🏗️ implement a complete web-based booking system together**.

This system will be **fully operational** and demonstrates how modern web applications are built in practice — from user interface to server logic and data storage.

After completing the shared implementation, you will apply the same concepts and techniques to **💡develop your own web application**, following similar architectural principles but with your own design and features.

---

## 🎯 Learning Focus

The scenario is built around **practical full-stack web development**, with a strong emphasis on how different parts of a web application work together:

* **🖥️ Front-end development**

  * User interfaces
  * Client-side logic
  * Browser-based interaction

* **⚙️ Back-end development**

  * Server-side logic
  * Authentication and authorization
  * Data handling and persistence

The goal is to understand **how front-end and back-end form a single, working system** 🔗.

---

## 🧩 System Overview

The example system is a **web-based resource booking system** with the following characteristics:

* The system is accessed through a **🌐 web browser** 
* Users can **🔐 register and log in** 
* A logged-in user has one of two roles:

  * **📅 Resource reserver**
  * **🛠️ Administrator**

---

### 👥 Roles and Core Functionality

**🛠️ Administrators** manage the system and can:

* Add, remove, and modify **resources**
* Add, remove, and modify **reservations**
* Delete existing **reserver accounts**

**📅 Reservers** can:

* Book available resources if they are **over 15 years old**
* Make bookings on an **hourly basis**

---

### 🔍 Visibility, Privacy, and System Behavior

* Booked resources are **👀 visible without logging in** 
* The **🔒 identity of the reserver is never shown publicly** 
* Role-based access control is enforced throughout the system

These requirements reflect **real-world constraints** and influence both front-end behavior and back-end logic.

---

### ✅ Scenario Outcome

By the end of the scenario, you will be able to:

* Build a **🧱 working full-stack web application** 
* Implement and connect front-end and back-end components
* Design systems that enforce roles and permissions
* Move from a guided example to an **🚀 independently developed application** 

This scenario emphasizes **🎓 working software, clear structure, and practical understanding**.
